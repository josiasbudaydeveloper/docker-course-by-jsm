-------------- VOLUMES --------------
Volumes are a way to manage the storage on the containers.

There are three types of volumes on Docker
- Named volumes (global volumes):
	Defined on the compose.yalm file outside of services.
	They can have any name and can be used by many different containers
- Bind mounts:
	They are used to mirror the host file system inside of the containers
	one.
	They are defined on the compose.yaml file inside of each container 
	(service) and follows the syntax: 
		"$(pwd)":<container path> 
- Anonymous volumes:
	They are used to preserve data on a specific container file system.
	They are not global and are defined following the syntax:
		<container path>
