-------------- DOCKER COMPOSE --------------
Docker Compose is a resource that allows for creating and manipulating
many related-containers once.

It works by defining a compose.yaml file that contains instructions about
how to build and set up all related-containers and volumes.

ON THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE compose.yaml FILE:
We can build those images and run all them with:
$ docker compose up

We can start or pause them with:
$ docker compose start/stop

-------------- DOCKER COMPOSE WATCH --------------
Docker Compose Watch is a feature that allows for watching files on those
containers and them do something:
- sync (similar to bind mounts)
- rebuild (for example, every time package.json and/or package-lock.json changes

To use Docker Compose Watch, we first have to start those containers.

ON THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE compose.yaml FILE:
docker compose watch

Then, if we make changes on those tracked files and directories, they will
start synchronizations or rebuilds, based on what we have configured on
compose.yaml file.
